            <div class="grid-container">
                <div class="card"><p>In the twilight's embrace, their love did bloom, <br>
                    two souls entwined, in passion's sweet perfume. <br>
                    Her heart whispered secrets, his echoed the same, <br>
                    bound by love's thread, they danced in flame. <br>
                    </div>
                <div class="card"><p>Through starlit nights and sun-kissed days, <br>
                    their love blossomed in countless ways. <br>
                    Hand in hand, they faced the world's test, <br>
                    in each other's arms, they found their rest. <br>
                    </p></div>
                <div class="card"><p>But seasons change, and so did they, <br>
                    their love, once fierce, began to sway. <br>
                    Words left unspoken, tears fell like rain, <br>
                    as their once vibrant love began to wane. <br>
                    </p></div>
                <div class="card"><p>The day arrived when they said goodbye, <br>
                    each tear shed, a silent cry. <br>
                    She longed to return to that fateful night, <br>
                    where their love sparkled in the moon's soft light. <br>
                    </p></div>
                <div class="card"><p>Yet, time marches on, memories fade, <br>
                    and what once was, begins to degrade. <br>
                    She's left with echoes of a love that's gone, <br>
                    in the stillness of night, she's all alone. <br>
                    </p></div>
                <div class="card"><p>So she holds onto moments, fleeting and rare, <br>
                    a bittersweet reminder of love's tender care. <br>
                    Though the path ahead may seem dark and steep, <br>
                    in her heart, the memories of love will forever keep.</p></p></div>
                <div class="card"><p>I am not the only traveler, <br>
                    who has not repaid his debt. <br>
                    I've been searching for a trail to follow again. <br>
                    Take me back to the night we met. <br>
                    </p></div>
                <div class="card"><p>Then I can tell myself, <br>
                    what the hell I'm supposed to do. <br>
                    Then I can tell myself, <br>
                    not to ride along with you. <br>
                    </p></div>
                <div class="card"><p>I had all and then most of you <br>
                    some and now none of you. <br>
                    Take me back to the night we met. <br>
                    </p></div>
                <div class="card"><p>I don't know what I'm supposed to do, <br>
                    haunted by the ghost of you. <br>
                    Oh, take me back to the night we met. <br>
                    </p></div>
                <div class="card"><p>When the night was full of terror, <br>
                    and your eyes were filled with tears, <br>
                    when you had not touched me yet. <br>
                    Oh! Take me back to the night we met. <br>
                    </p></div>
                <div class="card"><p>I had all and then most of you <br>

                    I don't know what I'm supposed to do <br>
                    haunted by the ghost of you, <br>
                    take me back to the night we met.</p></div>
